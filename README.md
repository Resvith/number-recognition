# Recognition of handwritten numbers
Builded CNN model with 3 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers. The model was trained on 50,000 images and tested on 10,000 images. The model achieved an accuracy of 99%. After the training and testing phases, the program displays samples of incorrectly predicted images along with their labels.

## Instalation
Clone the repo:
```git
git clone https://github.com/Resvith/number-recognition.git
```


Create virtual environment (venv) in directory when you clone the files:
```console
python -m venv venv
```


Activate your venv:
```console
venv\Scripts\activate
```


Install requirements packages from requirements.txt:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Done. Now you can easily run program:
```console
py CNN_number_recognition.py
```
